The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task:


On App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file /opt/finance/docker-compose.yml (should be named exactly).

The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:

For web service:

a. Container name must be php_web.

b. Use image php with any apache tag. Check here for more details https://hub.docker.com/_/php?tab=tags.

c. Map php_web container's port 80 with host port 5004

d. Map php_web container's /var/www/html volume with host volume /var/www/html.

For DB service:

a. Container name must be mysql_web.

b. Use image mariadb with any tag (preferably latest). Check here for more details https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb?tab=tags.

c. Map mysql_web container's port 3306 with host port 3306

d. Map mysql_web container's /var/lib/mysql volume with host volume /var/lib/mysql.

e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_web and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.

After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command curl <server-ip or hostname>:5004/

Note: Once you click on FINISH button, all currently running/stopped containers will be destroyed and stack will be deployed again using your compose file.
